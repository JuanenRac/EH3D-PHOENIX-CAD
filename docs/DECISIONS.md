# EH3D-PHOENIX-CAD: decisions that apply here

Decisions of the suite that shape this project, written as project documentation. A decision marked proposed is not final: this project must not rely on it silently, and where a number or a limit depends on it, the code will keep it as one named constant.

## Independent repositories related by contracts

State: **accepted**.

Every repository of the suite is independent. Repositories relate through versioned contracts and build next to each other as sibling folders. Programs never depend on each other: they exchange work through project files or through the server. The design tool does not depend at build time on the satellites that depend on it; it reaches them through their command line or through server tasks. A lower layer never depends on a higher one.

## The PHOENIX project keeps its own format

State: **accepted**.

The design tool stores everything in its own project format, with one folder per domain (design, mechanical, simulation, thermal, RF, history, passport, models, exports). The `.eh3dproj` package stays the exchange format for fabrication and is exported from it; the two are not nested. Domains this project does not know are preserved, and domains that change electrical or geometric meaning must be understood or the project is opened read-only.

## Geometry kernel for mechanical work

State: **proposed**.

No geometry kernel or constraint solver has been chosen. Candidates are compared on the same fixtures, checking robustness with degenerate input, licence compatibility with GPL-3.0-or-later and the ability to export STEP.

## Stable diagnostic codes

State: **proposed**.

Failures that a reader or a check cannot hide become diagnostics with a stable code of the form `PHOENIX-<AREA>-<NNN>` (the registry is kept in the board tool). A code is never reused or renumbered, its message may be translated but the code and field names are not, and a repository never keeps a private list: it asks for numbers in the registry in the same change that uses them, together with a test.

## Nothing here moves a machine

State: **accepted**.

Importing, converting, simulating or validating a design never starts motion, even as a side effect. Programs may at most prepare a job in the ready state through the server when a task says so; authorising, starting, confirming and cancelling are actions of a person. Computing tasks run without access to machine connectors.

## Private designs stay private

State: **accepted**.

The real projects of the author are never committed, pasted into issues or sent to a service. Tests use synthetic cases or minimal anonymised reproducers that the owner approved. Scripts that run over a private corpus use redacted mode, which reports only codes, counts, levels and hashes.
